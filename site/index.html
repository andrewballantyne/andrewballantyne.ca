    <h2 class="subPageHeader">Welcome</h2>
    <p>This is AndrewBallantyne.ca, a personal website for an Ottawa JavaScript Developer.</p>

    <p>I have lived in Ottawa my entire life and have been actively practicing and improving my programing knowledge for the past 12+
      years. In the past 5 to 6 years I have started to heavily focus on JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas in more recent years.</p>

    <h4 class="contentHeader">A few notes about this site</h4>

    <p>First and foremost, this site uses JavaScript for the navigation. If your browser has JavaScript turned off, unfortunately you
      will not have very much success navigating this site. There is really one main reason why I chose to do this, and it revolves
      around me enjoying personal projects that I engage in. During the course of standard work, I'm often required to implement features
      in ways I don't always agree with. So when I tackle projects on my personal time, I want to play with new or existing technologies
      that I am interested in.</p>

    <noscript><p>I'm sorry for any inconvenience this causes you, but really, it's 2016, where do you navigate on the web where
      JavaScript isn't used for some ad or website flair?</p></noscript>

    <p>This site is broken down into four main areas beyond this page:</p>
    <ul class="contentBulletList">
      <li><a href="#examples">examples</a> of my work, some of which will have links to view it</li>
      <li>general <a href="#about">about</a> knowledge, regarding work and technical experiences</li>
      <li>I've also included some <a href="#personal">personal</a> details, as I feel it's important for those interested in knowing more
        about who I am and what drives me</li>
      <li>a means of which to <a href="#contact">contact</a> me, should you be interested in extending employment opportunities or if
        you just wish to have conversations about JavaScript and front-end technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Technically speaking, this site uses jQuery and Bootstrap to style and manage the link/hash navigation. To set it up, it also made
    use of npm package.json, bower.json, and a gruntfile.js. If you wish to see the source, I have posted it to

        </div>
        <p>I decided to create this example in my spare time to explore the HTML5 Canvas tag. While using this new tag, I would be able to graphically create and manipulate each pixel; something that HTML is not known for. While working for the University of Windsor, I was surrounded by Flash and Adobe products. One of our future plans was to allow access to our web content via mobile devices, such as an iPhone. Unfortunately, since the Adobe Flash Player is not available for any Apple mobile device, the HTML5 Canvas route showed some promise. My desire with this example was to take what I have learned in my desktop programing examples and see if HTML5 Canvas could replicate them.</p>
        <p>For this example I almost exclusively used Javascript, with very little HTML and CSS to format the canvas tag and any other text that appears. The architecture of my project heavily relied on the use of Javascript prototypes "classes" and in some cases Javascript Inheritance, through prototypes. I made use of several event handlers, such as mouse down, mouse up, mouse move, and mouse scroll to make the mouse feel at home. I used a timer to control the animation and it runs at 20 frames a second.</p>

        <p>On March 1st, 2009 one of the web comics I was reading started up a Sunday only comic, which differed from the standard Monday to Saturday comics. This comic showed an origin story of the main character, which is often shown in a lighthearted manner.</p>
        <p>The web page was designed using Javascript and very little HTML. There was an assumption that every Sunday there would be a special comic, and by that assumption calculate how many Sunday's have happened since March 1st, 2009. With that number, a simple interface was design to allow you to navigate through all those dates and show each comic. The goal was to design a minimalistic user interface, so the focus would be on the comic. A simple cookie system was added to hold onto your comic number, to allow quick returns.</p>

        <p>Halogen Software ran a program they dubbed Leonardo Days; it was named after Leonardo da Vinci. The goal was to allow developers, QA and anyone really from Product Development to use half of a Friday every two weeks to work on any innovative idea they wanted, as long as it related to the main projects. This is similar to 'Google Days', implemented by Google.</p>
        <p>There was a need for an Org Chart to be created for the primary product in the coming year, so I decided to prototype it. Now HTML5 Canvas would 'never' (not within this decade at least) be able to be used in Halogen due to customer restrictions on browsers available, but I was allowed to pick my own technology and I was recently interested in HTML5 Canvas (after coming off of the <a href="#spaceExample">Space example</a> I noted above), so it seemed to be an easy choice.</p>
        <p>The project's main features was an expandable and collapsible series of nodes that would build into an Organization Chart. There was a number under that indicated how many bubbles (or people) were directly reporting to this individual. I pulled the information in via an array, since I was unable to have the proper time to connect it to the application. I made one major performance feature, which was to disable all rendering code and 'processing' code for any element that was fully off the screen. This allowed me to skip vast numbers of not visible bubbles.</p>
        <p>This example was entirely built from the ground up using the same (but improved) structure I used in the Solar Example Example.</p>

        <p>While working for the University of Windsor creating content for eLearning Ontario, our biggest hurdle was our content was too strongly reliant on reading. So a trial course was put together, that would have a teacher narrate the entire course. With all these audio files, we needed a player to play these audio files.</p>
        <p>I created a player in Flash from the ground up, completely creating all the controls. I was directed on a style by my boss, but design and functionality of the player was created by me. Graphically I make the background transparent so it could be used in any course (which all had their own colour code), as well as I added a drop shadow to make the player graphically more pleasing. In this example, I have created a sandbox to that will allow you to change the background of the HTML page that is behind the player, to show it's true transparency. The test file I was using was only 15 seconds in length, so I picked a music file off my machine to show the loading progress bar.</p>

        <p>I was requested to create a political site for a friend's father for his run for a City Councilor of Ottawa position. The site would be a venue for him to express his campaign and provide any news or guest appearances that he made. I provided an Admin Section for any oversight needed on mailing lists, sending a mail to any 'followers' and any other feature he requested. The website went through a few stages of development until the he withdrew from the campaign.</p>
        <p>To accomplish what was requested of me, I made use of HTML, CSS and Javascript to design the look and feel of the website and I used PHP to hook into a database to hold onto all the mailing list recipients. In the Admin Section I made use of PHP so he could send a mass e-mail out to all that signed up for the mailing list, as well as the ability to remove any bogus or unwanted recipients.</p>
